                    best solution to everyday problems.</p>

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Communication theorist:</h2>
                    <p> I've spent 7 years at 3 Universities (UCM, URJC, RUC) learning from some of the
                        best theorist (Juel,H; Lozano,J; Castañares,W; Saperas,E) how messages work, how media
                        codificates
                        meanings and how the audiences decodificate them.</p>

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Interviewer:</h2>
                    <p> Been working 5 years as a jornalist for different medias gives you that one, I guess. But I'm
                        slightly more grateful for learning how use the interviewees time wisely as a radio speaker.

                    <p>
                        You can´t find any cool stock photos at this page for a reason.
                        Working for a huge publishing group, browsering databases to find the right pictures and
                        illustrations for magazines, I learnt that graphic content has a price, so I decide to create
                        all of
                        mine from scratch (And I´m able to create ours if you want).</p>

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Sporadic Geologist:</h2>
                    <p> It's funny thought; but time ago I took my intentions of getting an holistical understanding of
                        the
                        world to the extent of enrole into the real Rock University. </p>

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Lomographer:</h2>
                    <p> I'm quite far away from being called a professional photographer, but I can proudly say that I
                        have
                        a good command of Lomography. My collection of film cameras walks with me like fire does with
                        Mr.Palmer. </p>

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Researcher:</h2>
                    <p> My preferred memory from my erasmus year is the moment when the staff introced me to the RUC
                        library; it was something mistical.
                        I think that this was my main path in life, to research about anything book-deeply.

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Digital iLLustrator</h2>
                    <p> I made every little bit of this website from scratch with an obsolete laptop on UI software
                        throught
                        an intense week, so, yeah, I´m that, for sure.

                    <h2 class="titulo"> Frustrated screenwriter</h2>
                    <p> This seems like something that maybe I should hide way deeper, but, since I started on the UX
                        field,
                        I discovered that I can use all the knowledge that I got from analyzing films and series to get
                        a
                        better definition of the user personas, their journeys, and scenarios. </p>
